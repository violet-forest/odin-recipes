    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This isn't cookie clicker anymore; make real chocolate chip cookies in
      your actual kitchen! They'll be a lot better than Chips Ahoy...
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 egg yolk</li>
      <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets
        or line with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.</li>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, cream together the melted butter, brown sugar and
        white sugar until well blended. Beat in the vanilla, egg, and egg yolk
        until light and creamy. Mix in the sifted ingredients until just
        blended. Stir in the chocolate chips by hand using a wooden spoon. Drop
        cookie dough 1/4 cup at a time onto the prepared cookie sheets. Cookies
        should be about 3 inches apart.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 15 to 17 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges are
        lightly toasted. Cool on baking sheets for a few minutes before
        transferring to wire racks to cool completely.
      </li>
    </ol>
