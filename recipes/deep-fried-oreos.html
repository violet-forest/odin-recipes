    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 cup pancake mix</li>
      <li>
        1 (18 ounce) package cream-filled chocolate sandwich cookies (such as
        OreoÂ®)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Whisk together the egg, milk, and 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil in a bowl
        until smooth. Stir in the pancake mix until no dry lumps remain. Dip the
        cookies into the batter one at a time, and carefully place into the hot
        frying oil. Fry only 4 or 5 at a time to avoid overcrowding the deep
        fryer. Cook until the cookies are golden-brown, about 2 minutes. Drain
        on a paper towel-lined plate before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
